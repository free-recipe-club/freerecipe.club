Your always-ad-free source for recipes from the heart.

## ðŸ¥– Project Structure

This project uses [Astro](https://astro.build/), as well as React, and Typescript.

Inside the project, the recipes and associated images are placed in the following directories:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ example_recipe.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recipes/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example_recipe.yml
```

This website looks for `.yml` files in the `src/recipes/` directory.

The recipe should have a `.jpg` file with a matching name located in the `public/images/` folder.
